**slides** - https://slideshare.net/atmb4u/data-driven-code

**simple.py** - if you are new to neural networks, this is where you should look at
**multiple.py** - same code being reused in different data scenarios in a very simple example. Code that learns from the data.
**demo.py** - similar to simple.py with just code and no documentation.
